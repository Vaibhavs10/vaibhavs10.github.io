## **What am I up to now?**

What am I focused on at this point in life?

Updated 15th July 2023, from Prague, CZ.

# 📚Research & Work

---

I submitted my thesis the other day! ⚡️- Now a much-needed break and going back to hobby projects 🚀 ([click here](https://twitter.com/reach_vb/status/1679839404553060355?s=20))

Work at Hugging Face has also been going quite well! I’ve been running experiments wit,h `Text Generation`, and we’ve got some cool upcoming `Text-to-Speech` things planned. Oh, and working on a cool benchmark, too 😉

# 🙋‍♂️Volunteering

---

The last 2-3 months have been hell-ish primarily because there are only 24 hours in a day. Some recent incidents have forced me to think more closely about where/ how I spend my time and energy.

I’m writing this update while I’m sitting on the train to Prague for EuroPython. Psyched to meet old friends and new ones. Also, to explore Prague.

*Fun fact*: Prague was the first European city I visited, and was my gateway to Europe.

# 🧠Mental health

---

Mental health has been great, I really pushed myself in the last couple of months. Desperately need some consistency with sleep though. It really shocks me how different life feels now versus same time last year.

A lot of this has been because of you, Sof! 🧁

# 🏡Next steps & “Home”

---

Now that the thesis is done thesis-ing. I’m going to focus on finding a stable environement. A place where I can do fun things all while having the liberty to explore my interests. Not quite sure where that’d be though - but I know it’ll be worthwhile.

# ✈️Travel & Q3 2023

---

I’d like to keep it easy-peasy travel wise for a bit, maybe take day trips here and there. Mostly just want to spend time in one place and enjoy the remaining summer.

What am I focused on at this point in life?

Updated 13th April 2025, from Paris, FR.

# üìö Research & Work
---

Life has been in hyper-drive since the last time I wrote one of these. My role at work (Hugging Face) has changed quite drastically, lot more high stakes and hell of a lot more fun.
Be it collaborating with some of the top labs, researching Audio LMs, Text-to-Speech or about helping the team excute new product ideas/ directions - it has been a hoot and a half.

It's also good realisation to take it easy every now and then, all gas and no pitstop is not as fun. That said, this job has pretty much made me an adrenaline junkie with so much cool stuff happening all around.

I'm also quite lucky to have people who have my best interests around me at work too, looking at you Julien, Lys, and Pedro - priviliged to be working with these lads!

Fun tid-bit: I've understood that I'm good for nothing in the mornings and usually my brain kicks-in around mid-day.

Lesson from last couple months - you/ your team is as good as the incentives they are provided with, change the incentives, you can change the outcomes!

# üôå Volunteering
---

Still haven't found the calm or the energy to get back to volunteering. More than the volunteering I do miss the friends I made along the way. I'm hoping I get a chance to meet some of these lovelies soon.

On the brightside, I'm moving on nicely from last years dramatic EuroPython :)

# üß† Mental health
---

Basically, endurance sports is all you need to get the good old man up in the head to stop playing tricks with you! Been running and biking off-late and it has been keeping me sane whilst everything around me is in hyperdrive.

This also means I have a huge dependence on running/ biking to take the edge off - spend Feb/ March battling with a crazy case of spint splints & plantar fasciitis and the mind did take a good toll.

Still, overall it's been mostly positive and I'm happy thet there's a consistent way to channelise energy now!

# üè° ‚ÄúHome‚Äù
---

Oof, loads of thinking about this one, whilst I really love where I live currently - it comes with it's own side effects. Mostly comes down to how deeply integrated one is in their surroundings. I love the nature around but it still doesn't feel like home, with friends scattered around different countries, I feel a little lost sometimes.
It's a chicken and egg problem, you need to put in the time to feel at home but at the same time because you don't feel at home you put in time in mindless pursuits.

Hoping to figure out long term plans soon and put them in motion ^^'

# ‚úàÔ∏è Travel & Public speaking
---

After two years of hiatus from public speaking, I'm getting back into action this year with a few guest lectures/ workshops and talks lined up already. Going to be fun rest of the year and I'm here for it!

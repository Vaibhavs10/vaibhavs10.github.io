This is just a fun exercise to export all the data from Strava over to a dataset so that I can create fun views and charts on top.

Pre-requisites:
1. Create an API application: https://www.strava.com/settings/api in your strava account (put all the website and other details as localhost)
2. Set API keys as Environment variables `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` & `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`

you can set the env variables simply by `export STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=...` & `export STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=...`

## Setup Python Environment

Pretty straightforward with `uv`: `uv venv --python 3.12`

Followed by, `source .venv/bin/activate`

You can install all required packages via `uv pip install pandas huggingface_hub`

## Python Codebase

You can also find the script here: https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/strava-analyse/blob/main/dump-data.py

```python
import os
import requests
import webbrowser
import json
import time
import pandas as pd
from huggingface_hub import HfApi, create_repo

api = HfApi()

# request initial token

redirect_uri = 'http://localhost:8000'

client_id = os.environ['STRAVA_CLIENT_ID']
client_secret = os.environ['STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET']

request_url = f'http://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id={client_id}' \
                      f'&response_type=code&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}' \
                      f'&approval_prompt=force' \
                      f'&scope=profile:read_all,activity:read_all'

webbrowser.open(request_url)
code = input('Insert the code from the url: ')
    
token = requests.post(url='https://www.strava.com/api/v3/oauth/token',
                     data={'client_id': client_id,
                           'client_secret': client_secret,
                           'code': code,
                           'grant_type': 'authorization_code'})
token = token.json()

# import all user activities

page = 1
response = []
count = 1

while True:
    
    # request new page of activities
    endpoint = f"https://www.strava.com/api/v3/athlete/activities?" \
                  f"access_token={token['access_token']}&" \
                  f"page={page}&" \
                  f"per_page=50"
    
    response = requests.get(endpoint).json()

    with open(f'data/data-{count}.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        json.dump(response, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
    
    count+=1

    # check if page contains activities
    if len(response):
        page += 1  

    else:
      break  

create_repo("reach-vb/strava-stats", repo_type="dataset", exists_ok=True)

api.upload_folder(
    folder_path="data/",
    path_in_repo="/", # Upload to a specific folder
    repo_id="reach-vb/strava-stats",
    repo_type="dataset",
    allow_patterns="*.json",
)

```

Note: when you run the script you'll be prompted to authorise access to your strava App. Once you click Authorise it'll redirect you too a page that doesn't exist ðŸ‘€.
Don't worry about it and look at the URL it is trying to redirect too, it should look something like `http://localhost:8000/?state=&code=e55c038bcf96ea6deff15c68649afc9554e6fbd6&scope=read,activity:read_all,profile:read_all`

The thing that matters to us is the string after `code`, just copy and paste it to the script and that's it! 

Once you've run it go over to your dataset on Hugging Face, here's mine for example: https://huggingface.co/datasets/reach-vb/strava-stats

Now go ahead and play with it and let me know how it goes.

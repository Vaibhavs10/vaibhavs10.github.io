I love running, and have recently embarked on the journey to race a marathon in June 2025. In the past, I've reached half-marathon distances multiple times, but have never went higher than that.

This page is a collection of resources and tips I've found online, that I either have found useful or would like to try out in the future.

## Training

1. It's recommended to follow a training plan, something that mixes speed work with longer runs. I'm using [Runna](https://runna.ai/) to generate and follow a plan (it's a bit expensive ~20 EUR/month).
2. Get a watch that at the very least tracks splits/ time elapsed. I recently upgraded to a Apple Watch Series 10 (~460 EUR) and it does it's job.
3. Comfy clothes that make you feel comfortable whilst running - decathalon has a very good selection (specially for winters), you don't need to spend a lot on this - but get this right, specially for winters.
4. Shoes - again this is quite vibe based, you cannot go wrong either way, this requires a bit of experimentation ofc - for ref I've been using 80 EUR Puma running shoes for past 1.5 years, and it's pretty good.

## Recovery

1. It's good to walk a km or two after runs, it helps bring the heart rate down and helps "settle" the legs.
2. Whilst the jury is out on the need of stretching, I've anecdotaly found static stretches to help feel quite a bit flexible the rest of the day.
3. It's a good idea to introduce one or two rest days in the week.
4. Magnesium helps with sore legs (I usually take 500mg after a long run).
5. Take a nice long shower, you deserve it, and you probably stink a lot too.

## Nutrition

Few basic things I've learned:
1. Make sure to drink enough water 30-45 minutes before the run, you can even take a bit of electrolytes (although no too much).
2. Chase up the run with a protein shake and chocolate milk, and drink loads of water in the hours after the run.
3. Avoid over caffeinating before the run (I've experimented a bit and I do well as long as I've had one coffee, more than that makes my heart race a bit too much).
4. Don't eat a big breakfast or anything that takes a long time to digests one hour before the run (avoid dairy, fiber and fruits)

### Up to 15 KMs

1. Carry on as you would for a normal run, but make sure to hydrate well after the run.
2. 

### Up to 30KMs

1. Take up 1-2 isotonic + energy gels, the goal is to get 60-80g catbs per hour of your run. (As of the date of the post, I haven't tried this yet)

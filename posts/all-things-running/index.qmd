I love running, and have recently embarked on the journey to race a marathon in June 2025. In the past, I've reached half-marathon distances multiple times, but have never went higher than that.

This page is a collection of resources and tips I've found online, that I either have found useful or would like to try out in the future.

## Training

1. It's recommended to follow a training plan, something that mixes speed work with longer runs. I'm using [Runna](https://runna.com/) to generate and follow a plan (it's a bit expensive ~20 EUR/month).
2. Get a watch that at the very least tracks splits/ time elapsed. I recently upgraded to a Apple Watch Series 10 (~460 EUR) and it does it's job.
3. Comfy clothes that make you feel comfortable whilst running - decathalon has a very good selection (specially for winters), you don't need to spend a lot on this - but get this right, specially for winters.
4. Shoes - again this is quite vibe based, you cannot go wrong either way, this requires a bit of experimentation ofc - for ref I've been using 80 EUR Puma running shoes for past 1.5 years, and it's pretty good.
5. Optional but recommended: create a Strava account, it's a great way to keep yourself motivated and track your progress. Here's [mine](https://www.strava.com/athletes/13731596).

## Recovery

1. It's good to walk a KM or two after runs, it helps bring the heart rate down and helps "settle" the legs - [good discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/raej53/do_you_walk_at_all_pre_or_post_run/).
2. Whilst the jury is out on the need of stretching, I've anecdotaly found static stretches to help feel quite a bit flexible the rest of the day - [here's what I follow](https://www.nike.com/a/stretches-after-running).
3. It's a good idea to introduce one or two rest days in the week - a [good reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/mjtv3j/how_necessary_are_rest_days/).
4. Magnesium helps with sore legs (I usually take 500mg after a long run) - [good read](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/nutrition/diet/a35947990/magnesium-benefits-for-runners/).
5. Take a nice long shower, you deserve it, and you probably stink a lot too ;) 

## Nutrition

Few basic things I've learned:

1. Make sure to drink enough water 30-45 minutes before the run, you can even take a bit of electrolytes (although no too much).
2. Chase up the run with a protein shake and chocolate milk, and drink loads of water in the hours after the run.
3. Avoid over caffeinating before the run (I've experimented a bit and I do well as long as I've had one coffee, more than that makes my heart race a bit too much).
4. Don't eat a big breakfast or anything that takes a long time to digests one hour before the run (avoid dairy, fiber and fruits)

Up to 15 KMs

1. Carry on as you would for a normal run, but make sure to hydrate well after the run.
2. Don't run till you hit a wall, everyone has different energy consumption, learn your limits, running on fumes almost always causes injury/ cramps.

Up to 30KMs

Take up 1-2 isotonic + energy gels, the goal is to get 60-80g catbs per hour of your run. (As of the date of the post, I haven't tried this yet)

## Things I'd like to include in my training

1. Strength training - specially for knees and ankles.
2. Cycling - I might pick this up on rest days just to boost my VO2 max a bit.

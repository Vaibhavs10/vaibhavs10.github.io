# Run Microsoft Phi-4 blazingly fast on your Mac

This is going to be a short post or rather a testlog for how to run the most accurate version of Microsoft Phi-4 on your Mac.

## Step 1: Setup ollama

On a mac, you can install ollama using homebrew:

```bash
brew install ollama
```

On a Windows/ Linux device, you can follow the instructions on the [Ollama Docs](https://ollama.com/download))

## Step 2: Kickstart Ollama

```bash
ollama serve
```

## Step 3: Run inference with Phi-4

After some research I found that the Phi-4 GGUFs from Unsloth are the most accurate. They ran bunch of evals and also converted the model to LLaMa format.
You can find it here: [unsloth/phi-4-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/phi-4-GGUF).

```bash
ollama run hf.co/unsloth/phi-4-GGUF
```

I'd also recommend reading the blogpost about the fixes for the Phi-4 model [here](https://unsloth.ai/blog/phi4).

## Step 4: Use it for your own tasks

That's the fun bit, once the model is loaded, you can do whatever you want, at the touch of your terminal.

Go on and try out some of your own prompts, and see how it works.

Bonus: Now go try other [GGUF models on the Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf) and compare their performance with Phi 4.

and.. that's it!

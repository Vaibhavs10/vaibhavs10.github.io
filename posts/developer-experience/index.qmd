This post is a a collection of my thoughts on Developer Experience/ Relations and some predictions for the future.

## What makes a good DevX/ DevRel?

Simply put: It's the one where a developer using your tool/ product doesn't even know that you exist.

You want to have enough pathways for the developer to find your product/ tool/ service and get whatever they need done without having to ask/ search for you.
More so you want to meet your developers where they are - GitHub, X, Discord, Slack, etc.
You want to be there when they need you, not when you want to be there.

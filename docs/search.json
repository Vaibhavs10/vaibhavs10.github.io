    "text": "What am I focused on at this point in life?\nUpdated 24th June 2024, from Paris, FR.\n\nüìö Research & Work\n\nWork has been hectic but enjoyable. I have been forunate to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the field at the moment. I have been spending more time understanding the intrecacies and implications of running ML on the edge.\nI haven‚Äôt been able to find a single continuous block of time to put my head down and do good old research or even read papers in a long while. Still not sure what‚Äôs the best way, but I‚Äôll figure it out.\n\n\nüôå Volunteering\n\nI stepped back from EuroPython organisation and am looking forward to complete my tenure this year. Truth be told, there was a lot of friction (mostly because of me) this year. I‚Äôm happy to see the chapter close with my best friends in the coming weeks. The past 1.5 years have been quite chaotic, moving countries, building a home, settling in has all been incredibly taxing. I‚Äôm looking forward to having less things on my plate and focus on getting better.\nOn the bright side, I have been dabbling in the education side of things, keep your eyes peeled for some fun projects soon. :)\n\n\nüß† Mental health\n\nSounds unbelievable but I have been quite stable (mentally) in the recent times. I do owe a lot of this to Sof. I am quite lucky to have her in my life, she just knows how to comfort me and ndges me with the right prompts. She‚Äôs a good prompt engineer ;)\nMy physical health on the other hand has been on a decline, I fall sick at the drop of the hat and it‚Äôs not fun loading up on medicines every other week. Although, I did recently get back into running and picked up longboarding, both are fun and good ways to keep the blood flowing. With a little bit of consistency I might get better afterall.\nNote: I still suck at keeping in touch with people, hoping I auto-magically fix it soon.\n\n\nüè° ‚ÄúHome‚Äù\n\nWe found a nice spot outside of Paris, there‚Äôs the Seine on one side and a big forest on the other. It is away from the chaos of the city at the same time isn‚Äôt as far if we want to go ride the boards by the Seine. I have been learning French, slowly making progress on that front. It does get a bit isolating sometimes since I haven‚Äôt quite gotten around making good friends here yet.\nA friend from Stuttgart visited recently, it was good relive some old memories and have some fun in the process.\n\n\n‚úàÔ∏è Travel & Plans going forward\n\nWhen this year started both Sof and I decided to reduce travel to bare minimum. I don‚Äôt know where this got out of hand, but June was the only month where we did not travel anywhere, looking forward it looks like this would be the case for the whole year.\nUp next, I‚Äôll be at EuroPython in Prague. If you‚Äôre around say hi!"

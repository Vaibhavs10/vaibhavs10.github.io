    "text": "What am I focused on at this point in life?\nUpdated 30th September 2024, from Stuttgart, DE.\n\nüìö Research & Work\n\nWork has been hectic but enjoyable. I have been forunate to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the field at the moment. I have been spending more time understanding the intrecacies and implications of running ML on the edge and deployment.\nI haven‚Äôt been able to find a single continuous block of time to put my head down and do good old research or even read papers in a long while. Still not sure what‚Äôs the best way, but I‚Äôll figure it out.\nIt‚Äôs been quite surreal to see some of the projects that I worked on be out and about in the wild making real-life impact. Time to double down on what gets the blood pumping.\n\n\nüôå Volunteering\n\nI stepped back from EuroPython organisation and am looking forward to complete my tenure this year. Truth be told, there was a lot of friction (mostly because of me) this year. I‚Äôm happy to see the chapter close with my best friends in the coming weeks. The past 1.5 years have been quite chaotic, moving countries, building a home, settling in has all been incredibly taxing. I‚Äôm looking forward to having less things on my plate and focus on getting better.\nI have been dedicating extra chunk of time working on building Proof of Concepts/ examples/ tutorials on using better, more powerful AI models at the touch of your computer.\n\n\nüß† Mental health\n\nSounds unbelievable but I have been quite stable (mentally) in the recent times. I do owe a lot of this to Sof. I am quite lucky to have her in my life, she just knows how to comfort me and ndges me with the right prompts. She‚Äôs a good prompt engineer ;)\nMy physical health on the other hand has been on a decline, I fall sick at the drop of the hat and it‚Äôs not fun loading up on medicines every other week. Although, I did recently get back into running and picked up longboarding, both are fun and good ways to keep the blood flowing. With a little bit of consistency I might get better afterall.\nNote: I still suck at keeping in touch with people, hoping I auto-magically fix it soon.\n\n\nüè° ‚ÄúHome‚Äù\n\nSpent the last couple days in Stuttgart, reliving the old days, meeting friends and people I spent considerable amount of last 4 years with. I find myself thinking/ fascinating about where should I move next - each country, city and street has pros and cons. But, spending time figuring out what is it that I like in a city is fun. The introspection and discussion around this would make for a blogpost on its own - looking forward to writing it.\nI do quite enjoy where I live currently - It‚Äôs just nothing beats being able to walk in a forest, hill all less than one hour by public transport from you (looking at you Stuttgart).\n\n\n‚úàÔ∏è Travel & Plans going forward\n\nWhen this year started both Sof and I decided to reduce travel to bare minimum. I don‚Äôt know where this got out of hand, but June was the only month where we did not travel anywhere, looking forward it looks like this would be the case for the whole year.\nGearing up for some intense travel till the end of the year! üòÖ"

    "text": "I‚Äôm a strong believer that as we continue to traverse the AI/ ASI/ AGI landscape, the net compute required for accessing it would decrease i.e.¬†we‚Äôll get smaller but stronger models.\nAs these models continue to become smaller and stronger, it‚Äôs more likely that you can run inference directly on your device and replace your on-line/ API based LLM usage (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc). Hence, I continue to keep an eye out for smaller models.\nThe big question here, is what use-cases do you actually use these on-device models for?\nI use them for a few select task, like, rewriting, summarizing, quick syntax lookups, or just quick vibe checks on a topic (asking the model to critique what I‚Äôve written) and creative explorations.\nThis brings us to Phi 3.5. The other day, Microsoft released an update to their Phi series of small scale LLMs: Phi 3.5.\nThe highlight: Phi 3.5 mini, MoE and vision with 128K context, multilingual & MIT license! üî•\nThe MoE beats Gemini flash and the Vision model is competitive with GPT4o.\nSome quick notes on the models and they atleast look good on benchmarks:\nMini with 3.8B parameters\nMoE with 16x3.8B (6.6B active - 2 experts)\nPh3.5 Vision with 4.2B params\nThe star of the show for me atleast is the Phi-3.5 Mini, it looks like decently sized model which would make it easy to fine-tune for specific tasks.\nAlright, enough of about the models, let‚Äôs try to see if we can run this model on your Mac/Windows/Linux device.\nThere are multiple ways to run a model on-device - you can use, transformers, llama.cpp, MLC, ONNXRuntime and bunch others. One of the easiest ways however is to use llama.cpp, once setup - it just works across pretty much all well-known model architectures."

    "text": "Written on 26th December 2023, from Gurgaon, India.\nI‚Äôm currently in India, and as someone who doesn‚Äôt actively live in the country anymore, it is always a bittersweet experience whenever I travel between countries.\nTravelling to India üõ¨ - Is a joyride; it evokes the feeling of belongingness paired with the anticipation of meeting my loved ones, eating some good food (not butter chicken), and most of all, being in a place of comfort. It‚Äôs a place where I‚Äôve messed up umpteen numbers of times and gotten back up.\nTravelling out of India üõ´¬†- Is an emotional rollercoaster; not knowing when I will see my loved ones again evokes a feeling of emptiness, and the short life doesn‚Äôt make the departure easy. At the same time, the knowledge that I‚Äôll return to another country that I call home, living the life I chose, makes me feel elated.\nAll of this begs to answer the question: what is home? ‚ò∫Ô∏è\nI went to the mountains recently, which involved a lot of sitting in the car and a lot of time to ponder this topic.\nHere are some unkempt thoughts:\n\nIt is a place where you can be yourself. A place where you can express yourself without the fear of being judged.\nA place where you can be vulnerable.\nIt is a person who tells you you‚Äôve messed up and helps you while you fix it.\nWhere you feel motivated to get better (financially/ physically/ mentally) for your home.\nIt is a safe place where you can exist.\n\nIn the recent past (half a decade), I‚Äôve been quite lucky and privileged to build a few:\n\nMy best friend turned partner, Sofdog - My life wouldn‚Äôt be as worthwhile and fruitful as it is now if it weren‚Äôt for her watching out for me. Having tough conversations where we can be vulnerable and express ourselves without feeling judged, all whilst sharing the passion of exploring the world one city at a time.\nMum, Dad & my sister - Even though we‚Äôre often a couple of thousand kilometres apart, I‚Äôve never felt lonely all because these three have ensured I‚Äôve always been at ease. They‚Äôve always been there through thick and thin. I am lucky to have grown with such inclusive and progressive thoughts.\nFriends - Raquel, Patrick, Emils, Sven, and Zeina - Have played an important role in my life. They‚Äôve helped me max out life whilst being around me when I was hurting or guiding me when I was clueless.\nStuttgart - I spent my best life so far in Stuttgart. I got the time and space to dive deep into my research, all whilst making connections I‚Äôll cherish until the end. However, I‚Äôve moved away from Stuttgart recently. It will continue to be a place that I‚Äôll think fondly of.\n\nSo, in the end, what is home? üòä\nAs this year (2023) dawns to an end, I‚Äôm quite bullish on the next few. I can‚Äôt wait to build new homes.\nI‚Äôd love to know what makes you feel at home. Send me a DM on Twitter or drop me a ping at reachvaibhavs10[at]gmail[dot]com\nCheers! üçª VB\nAppendix - FAQ\n\nYou‚Äôve changed in recent times. That‚Äôs correct; I am a bit snobbier now (always a delhite); I take things way more lightly now. I‚Äôm more direct (don‚Äôt mince my words). I‚Äôm sorry if my words hurt you.\nDo I still have a tolerance for Spice? No.¬†It causes me intense pain in the belly. And no, I do not want to build it back up.\nDo I intend to come back to India to live long-term? Not in the immediate future (&lt; 2 years), and I do not plan life more than two years in advance. I‚Äôll continue to visit, albeit a bit more frequently now.\nWhat do you not like about India? First, I love Delhi, and it‚Äôll forever be my home. That said, I don‚Äôt like the political climate in India. I despise the pollution. The traffic is nightmare fuel. And no, this is not up for discussion. I find conversations like those to be not worth your or my time.\nPeople in tech get paid much more in India than in Europe. That‚Äôs great, and I‚Äôm quite happy for the tech scene in India.\nDo I make good money? I make enough to have food on the table and some occasional trips here and there. That‚Äôs more than sufficient for me. But, deffo something I will improve in ‚Äô24."

    "text": "Why I don‚Äôt take calls and take ages to respond?\nI often get my butt kicked for not responding to acquaintances and colleagues on time. I also get the stink eye for refusing to do meetings, phone/ zoom calls, and everything that comes with them.\nTo be honest, a one-hour physical meeting can be a 30-minute virtual meeting, a 30-minute virtual meeting can be a 10-minute phone call, and a 10-minute phone call can be a 2-minute email.\nI prefer written communication. It‚Äôs documented, clear, and doesn‚Äôt require me to break my focus.\nBut why avoid meetings in the first place? Isn‚Äôt face-to-face interaction better?\nI have the attention span of a peanut. It often takes me ages to find inspiration. Once I find that inspiration, I like capitalising on it as much as possible. Given how fickle my mind is I tend to aggressively preserve my ‚Äúinspired time‚Äù.\nWhile face-to-face interactions ‚Äúmay‚Äù be better. They do result in an absurd amount of cognitive load.\nSo why make life difficult for both you and me? Async rules!\nWhat about virtual meetings?

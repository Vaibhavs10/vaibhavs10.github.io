    "text": "What am I focused on at this point in life?\nUpdated 13th April 2025, from Paris, FR.\n\n📚 Research & Work\n\nLife has been in hyper-drive since the last time I wrote one of these. My role at work (Hugging Face) has changed quite drastically, lot more high stakes and hell of a lot more fun. Be it collaborating with some of the top labs, researching Audio LMs, Text-to-Speech or about helping the team excute new product ideas/ directions - it has been a hoot and a half.\nIt’s also good realisation to take it easy every now and then, all gas and no pitstop is not as fun. That said, this job has pretty much made me an adrenaline junkie with so much cool stuff happening all around.\nI’m also quite lucky to have people who have my best interests around me at work too, looking at you Julien, Lys, and Pedro - priviliged to be working with these lads!\nFun tid-bit: I’ve understood that I’m good for nothing in the mornings and usually my brain kicks-in around mid-day.\nLesson from last couple months - you/ your team is as good as the incentives they are provided with, change the incentives, you can change the outcomes!\n\n\n🙌 Volunteering\n\nStill haven’t found the calm or the energy to get back to volunteering. More than the volunteering I do miss the friends I made along the way. I’m hoping I get a chance to meet some of these lovelies soon.\nOn the brightside, I’m moving on nicely from last years dramatic EuroPython :)\n\n\n🧠 Mental health\n\nBasically, endurance sports is all you need to get the good old man up in the head to stop playing tricks with you! Been running and biking off-late and it has been keeping me sane whilst everything around me is in hyperdrive.\nThis also means I have a huge dependence on running/ biking to take the edge off - spend Feb/ March battling with a crazy case of spint splints & plantar fasciitis and the mind did take a good toll.\nStill, overall it’s been mostly positive and I’m happy thet there’s a consistent way to channelise energy now!\n\n\n🏡 “Home”\n\nOof, loads of thinking about this one, whilst I really love where I live currently - it comes with it’s own side effects. Mostly comes down to how deeply integrated one is in their surroundings. I love the nature around but it still doesn’t feel like home, with friends scattered around different countries, I feel a little lost sometimes. It’s a chicken and egg problem, you need to put in the time to feel at home but at the same time because you don’t feel at home you put in time in mindless pursuits.\nHoping to figure out long term plans soon and put them in motion ^^’\n\n\n✈️ Travel & Public speaking\n\nAfter two years of hiatus from public speaking, I’m getting back into action this year with a few guest lectures/ workshops and talks lined up already. Going to be fun rest of the year and I’m here for it!"

    "text": "Why I don’t take calls and take ages to respond?\nI often get my butt kicked for not responding to acquaintances and colleagues on time. I also get the stink eye for refusing to do meetings, phone/ zoom calls, and everything that comes with them.\nTo be honest, a one-hour physical meeting can be a 30-minute virtual meeting, a 30-minute virtual meeting can be a 10-minute phone call, and a 10-minute phone call can be a 2-minute email.\nI prefer written communication. It’s documented, clear, and doesn’t require me to break my focus.\nBut why avoid meetings in the first place? Isn’t face-to-face interaction better?\nI have the attention span of a peanut. It often takes me ages to find inspiration. Once I find that inspiration, I like capitalising on it as much as possible. Given how fickle my mind is I tend to aggressively preserve my “inspired time”.\nWhile face-to-face interactions “may” be better. They do result in an absurd amount of cognitive load.\nSo why make life difficult for both you and me? Async rules!\nWhat about virtual meetings? They are a good proxy for in-person meetings and don’t often require as much time.\nTrue-ish, but if I know I have a meeting on a particular day, I’d constantly be stressing out about it. Irrespective of the contents of the meeting, I’d be consumed by it and have a sub-optimal experience.\nHow do I reach you?\nEmail me at Vaibhavs10[at]gmail[dot]com or drop a line on twitter @reach_vb 🤗\nLive async, live happy!"

    "text": "Written on 26th December 2023, from Gurgaon, India.\nI’m currently in India, and as someone who doesn’t actively live in the country anymore, it is always a bittersweet experience whenever I travel between countries.\nTravelling to India 🛬 - Is a joyride; it evokes the feeling of belongingness paired with the anticipation of meeting my loved ones, eating some good food (not butter chicken), and most of all, being in a place of comfort. It’s a place where I’ve messed up umpteen numbers of times and gotten back up.\nTravelling out of India 🛫 - Is an emotional rollercoaster; not knowing when I will see my loved ones again evokes a feeling of emptiness, and the short life doesn’t make the departure easy. At the same time, the knowledge that I’ll return to another country that I call home, living the life I chose, makes me feel elated.\nAll of this begs to answer the question: what is home? ☺️\nI went to the mountains recently, which involved a lot of sitting in the car and a lot of time to ponder this topic.\nHere are some unkempt thoughts:\n\nIt is a place where you can be yourself. A place where you can express yourself without the fear of being judged.\nA place where you can be vulnerable.\nIt is a person who tells you you’ve messed up and helps you while you fix it.\nWhere you feel motivated to get better (financially/ physically/ mentally) for your home.\nIt is a safe place where you can exist.\n\nIn the recent past (half a decade), I’ve been quite lucky and privileged to build a few:\n\nMy best friend turned partner, Sofdog - My life wouldn’t be as worthwhile and fruitful as it is now if it weren’t for her watching out for me. Having tough conversations where we can be vulnerable and express ourselves without feeling judged, all whilst sharing the passion of exploring the world one city at a time.\nMum, Dad & my sister - Even though we’re often a couple of thousand kilometres apart, I’ve never felt lonely all because these three have ensured I’ve always been at ease. They’ve always been there through thick and thin. I am lucky to have grown with such inclusive and progressive thoughts.\nFriends - Raquel, Patrick, Emils, Sven, and Zeina - Have played an important role in my life. They’ve helped me max out life whilst being around me when I was hurting or guiding me when I was clueless.\nStuttgart - I spent my best life so far in Stuttgart. I got the time and space to dive deep into my research, all whilst making connections I’ll cherish until the end. However, I’ve moved away from Stuttgart recently. It will continue to be a place that I’ll think fondly of.\n\nSo, in the end, what is home? 😊\nAs this year (2023) dawns to an end, I’m quite bullish on the next few. I can’t wait to build new homes.\nI’d love to know what makes you feel at home. Send me a DM on Twitter or drop me a ping at reachvaibhavs10[at]gmail[dot]com\nCheers! 🍻 VB\nAppendix - FAQ\n\nYou’ve changed in recent times. That’s correct; I am a bit snobbier now (always a delhite); I take things way more lightly now. I’m more direct (don’t mince my words). I’m sorry if my words hurt you.\nDo I still have a tolerance for Spice? No. It causes me intense pain in the belly. And no, I do not want to build it back up.\nDo I intend to come back to India to live long-term? Not in the immediate future (&lt; 2 years), and I do not plan life more than two years in advance. I’ll continue to visit, albeit a bit more frequently now.\nWhat do you not like about India? First, I love Delhi, and it’ll forever be my home. That said, I don’t like the political climate in India. I despise the pollution. The traffic is nightmare fuel. And no, this is not up for discussion. I find conversations like those to be not worth your or my time.\nPeople in tech get paid much more in India than in Europe. That’s great, and I’m quite happy for the tech scene in India.\nDo I make good money? I make enough to have food on the table and some occasional trips here and there. That’s more than sufficient for me. But, deffo something I will improve in ’24."

    "text": "I’m a strong believer that as we continue to traverse the AI/ ASI/ AGI landscape, the net compute required for accessing it would decrease i.e. we’ll get smaller but stronger models.\nAs these models continue to become smaller and stronger, it’s more likely that you can run inference directly on your device and replace your on-line/ API based LLM usage (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc). Hence, I continue to keep an eye out for smaller models.\nThe big question here, is what use-cases do you actually use these on-device models for?\nI use them for a few select task, like, rewriting, summarizing, quick syntax lookups, or just quick vibe checks on a topic (asking the model to critique what I’ve written) and creative explorations.\nThis brings us to Phi 3.5. The other day, Microsoft released an update to their Phi series of small scale LLMs: Phi 3.5.\nThe highlight: Phi 3.5 mini, MoE and vision with 128K context, multilingual & MIT license! 🔥\nThe MoE beats Gemini flash and the Vision model is competitive with GPT4o.\nSome quick notes on the models and they atleast look good on benchmarks:\nMini with 3.8B parameters\nMoE with 16x3.8B (6.6B active - 2 experts)\nPh3.5 Vision with 4.2B params\nThe star of the show for me atleast is the Phi-3.5 Mini, it looks like decently sized model which would make it easy to fine-tune for specific tasks.\nAlright, enough of about the models, let’s try to see if we can run this model on your Mac/Windows/Linux device.\nThere are multiple ways to run a model on-device - you can use, transformers, llama.cpp, MLC, ONNXRuntime and bunch others. One of the easiest ways however is to use llama.cpp, once setup - it just works across pretty much all well-known model architectures."

It’s almost critical to eat something within 30 minutes of your run.\nAvoid over caffeinating before the run (I’ve experimented a bit and I do well as long as I’ve had one coffee, more than that makes my heart race a bit too much).\nDon’t eat a big breakfast or anything that takes a long time to digests one hour before the run (avoid dairy, fiber and fruits).\nHaving a carb rich meal before the run helps feeling overall more energetic throughout the run (I’ve just started experimenting with this).\n\nUp to 15 KMs\n\nCarry on as you would for a normal run, but make sure to hydrate well after the run.\nDon’t run till you hit a wall, everyone has different energy consumption, learn your limits, running on fumes almost always causes injury/ cramps.\nIt’s worth getting atleast two seperate running shoes, which you alternate between runs - this helps with overuse injuries.\nAs long as it’s more than an hour, taking a gel is more than recommended.\n\nUp to 30KMs\n\nTake up 1-2 isotonic + energy gels, the goal is to get 60-80g catbs per hour of your run.

    "text": "Zone 2 Running\nFor the past 4-5 weeks (from 25th May) I’ve been experimenting doing a lot of volume at Easy pace, and I mean really easy pace. The real motivation was to reduce the number of times I got injured whilst trying to build volume.\nThat said, it’s brutal and humbles you quite quickly. As someone who suffered from Asthma growing up and basically kept an arms length away from sports it’s been surreal trying to run slowly.\nHere’s some stuff I’ve learnt about it:\n\nIt’s going to be tough. Jogging is your best friend.\nGo slow but try to go long (even if it means that you walk for prolonged periods of time).\nMeasure your heart rate, try to stay within the zone, ofc if you go uphill hte you might dip into Z3, it’s okay - don’t overthink it.\nTry to add some strides before cool down, they are a good way to keep the fun alive.\nBe prepared to be humbled, everyone and their mums will be faster than you on strava, remember, it’s all for you - fuck the rest.\nTry to focus on cadence, try to keep it above 165 (it’ll help you avoid injuries).\nIt’s going to get better sooner than you think.\n\natm I’m average from 07:00-08:30/ km in Zone 2, I started at 09:30/ km 5 weeks back, you build good posture and cadence back."

    "section": "Example: Local Browser Agent",
    "text": "Example: Local Browser Agent\nLet’s build a browser agent that can browse and search the internet for you. We’ve already implemented this in /browser-agent directory in case you want to skip ahead.\n\nStep 0: Log in to Hugging Face\nhuggingface-cli login\nThis will ask you for your HF API token. You can get it from here.\n\n\nStep 1: Define the Agent\nBoth the JS and Python Tiny agent clients are meant to be quite easy to play and experiment with. They expect a transparent agent.json which includes the details of which LLM should be used and what tools it should have access to.\nLet’s define our agent using OpenAI’s latest gpt-oss 120B as the LLM and connect it to this Playwright MCP server that provides browser automation capabilities to your agent. We’ve added this in /browser-agent/agent.json for you to use.\n{\n    \"model\": \"openai/gpt-oss-120b\",\n    \"provider\": \"fireworks-ai\",\n    \"servers\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"stdio\",\n            \"command\": \"npx\",\n            \"args\": [\"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\nOptionally, we can define a System Prompt that helps steer the LLM. This is defined in /browser-agent/PROMPT.md for you to use.\n\nYou are an agent - please keep going until the user’s query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved, or if you need more info from the user to solve the problem.\nIf you are not sure about anything pertaining to the user’s request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.\nYou MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.\nHelp the User with their task.\n\n\nThat's it, let's take it out for a spin.\n\n### Step 2: Run the agent\n\nTo run the agent in Python, we simply install the `tiny-agents` package, which is part of the `huggingface_hub` library.\n\n```bash\npip install -U \"huggingface_hub[mcp]&gt;=0.32.0\"\nFollowed by running our agent:\ntiny-agents run ./browser-agent\n\n\n\nCLI Init Browser\n\n\nWhen the agent starts, you can chat with it to ask him to solve tasks. For example, try to ask it to find the top 10 Hugging Face models, and see if it’s able to connect to the website using the Playwright MCP tool we configured!\n\n[!NOTE] You can do exactly the same thing with our JavaScript client as well.\nnpx @huggingface/tiny-agents run ./browser-agent\n\n\n\n\nBrowser Agent Demo\n\n\nVoila, you now have a capable browser agent with you!"

    "text": "TL;DR - Watch Felix Kjellberg’s “STOP. Using AI Right now.” (31 October 2025) to see his 10‑GPU setup and custom UI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw4fDU18RcU. - You can recreate the workflow with consumer gear—start with 7B–20B quantized models in llama.cpp or Apple’s MLX, then scale up if you add VRAM. - The real goal is autonomy: keep data off third-party APIs, wire in your own search/memory, and iterate until the tooling feels personal.\nFelix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg recently shared a video showing his $20K, 10‑GPU rack plus a custom UI he calls Chad OS. What’s interesting isn’t the hardware—it’s how much of his approach works on a single GPU tower or an Apple Silicon laptop. This guide breaks down his setup for people who want to run AI locally without being deep-learning engineers.\nFelix emphasizes two points in the video: “I don’t want to API my way out of everything,” and “Delete. Delete. … Oh, so they collect your data even if you deleted it.” Everything below follows that mindset—local-first, privacy-aware experiments you can scale up or down based on your hardware.\nPick the path that matches your hardware, dive deeper with the links, and don’t feel obligated to chase 8×4090 setups."

Each llama-server instance can host multiple models—add a second --model block or run another process on a new port. Pair each endpoint with a different --system-prompt or saved preset to recreate his council voting approach:\nllama-server --hf-repo bartowski/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF \\\n  --hf-file qwen2.5-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf \\\n  --port 8081 --ctx-size 8192 --threads 10 \\\n  --chat-template chatml\nPrefer terminals? The CLI flows stay the same—keep --batch-size 1 for interactive chats, then scale toward 64+ only when you’re benchmarking or streaming to multiple clients. Match --ctx-size to the longest prompt you actually need:\nllama-cli --hf-repo bartowski/GPT-OSS-20B-GGUF \\\n  --hf-file GPT-OSS-20B-Q4_K_M.gguf \\\n  --prompt \"Summarize Felix's council experiment in 80 words.\" \\\n  --ctx-size 4096\nllama-cli --hf-repo bartowski/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF \\\n  --hf-file qwen2.5-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf \\\n  --chat --prompt \"Create a persona for a skeptical council member.\" \\\n  --ctx-size 6144\nNeed more throughput? Raise --batch-size gradually (4 → 16 → 64) while watching latency and GPU memory. Interactive chats usually feel best between batch sizes 1 and 4.\nDual GPUs? Split tensors so each card shares the load—Felix’s “council” runs this way, then a supervisor script scores responses and “kills” the losers. Start with even splits and add a simple vote tally in Python to replicate this:\nllama-cli --hf-repo bartowski/GPT-OSS-20B-GGUF \\\n  --hf-file GPT-OSS-20B-Q4_K_M.gguf \\\n  --tensor-split 50,50 --ctx-size 4096 --chat\n\nThe layout below mirrors Felix’s WebUI: pinned sidebar, quick preset buttons, and two council members ready to vote.\n\n\n\nReference llama.cpp layout"

    "text": "What am I focused on at this point in life?\nUpdated 13th April 2025, from Paris, FR.\n\nüìö Research & Work\n\nLife has been in hyper-drive since the last time I wrote one of these. My role at work (Hugging Face) has changed quite drastically, lot more high stakes and hell of a lot more fun. Be it collaborating with some of the top labs, researching Audio LMs, Text-to-Speech or about helping the team excute new product ideas/ directions - it has been a hoot and a half.\nIt‚Äôs also good realisation to take it easy every now and then, all gas and no pitstop is not as fun. That said, this job has pretty much made me an adrenaline junkie with so much cool stuff happening all around.\nI‚Äôm also quite lucky to have people who have my best interests around me at work too, looking at you Julien, Lys, and Pedro - priviliged to be working with these lads!\nFun tid-bit: I‚Äôve understood that I‚Äôm good for nothing in the mornings and usually my brain kicks-in around mid-day.\nLesson from last couple months - you/ your team is as good as the incentives they are provided with, change the incentives, you can change the outcomes!\n\n\nüôå Volunteering\n\nStill haven‚Äôt found the calm or the energy to get back to volunteering. More than the volunteering I do miss the friends I made along the way. I‚Äôm hoping I get a chance to meet some of these lovelies soon.\nOn the brightside, I‚Äôm moving on nicely from last years dramatic EuroPython :)\n\n\nüß† Mental health\n\nBasically, endurance sports is all you need to get the good old man up in the head to stop playing tricks with you! Been running and biking off-late and it has been keeping me sane whilst everything around me is in hyperdrive.\nThis also means I have a huge dependence on running/ biking to take the edge off - spend Feb/ March battling with a crazy case of spint splints & plantar fasciitis and the mind did take a good toll.\nStill, overall it‚Äôs been mostly positive and I‚Äôm happy thet there‚Äôs a consistent way to channelise energy now!\n\n\nüè° ‚ÄúHome‚Äù\n\nOof, loads of thinking about this one, whilst I really love where I live currently - it comes with it‚Äôs own side effects. Mostly comes down to how deeply integrated one is in their surroundings. I love the nature around but it still doesn‚Äôt feel like home, with friends scattered around different countries, I feel a little lost sometimes. It‚Äôs a chicken and egg problem, you need to put in the time to feel at home but at the same time because you don‚Äôt feel at home you put in time in mindless pursuits.\nHoping to figure out long term plans soon and put them in motion ^^‚Äô\n\n\n‚úàÔ∏è Travel & Public speaking\n\nAfter two years of hiatus from public speaking, I‚Äôm getting back into action this year with a few guest lectures/ workshops and talks lined up already. Going to be fun rest of the year and I‚Äôm here for it!"

It‚Äôs almost critical to eat something within 30 minutes of your run.\nAvoid over caffeinating before the run (I‚Äôve experimented a bit and I do well as long as I‚Äôve had one coffee, more than that makes my heart race a bit too much).\nDon‚Äôt eat a big breakfast or anything that takes a long time to digests one hour before the run (avoid dairy, fiber and fruits).\nHaving a carb rich meal before the run helps feeling overall more energetic throughout the run (I‚Äôve just started experimenting with this).\n\nUp to 15 KMs\n\nCarry on as you would for a normal run, but make sure to hydrate well after the run.\nDon‚Äôt run till you hit a wall, everyone has different energy consumption, learn your limits, running on fumes almost always causes injury/ cramps.\nIt‚Äôs worth getting atleast two seperate running shoes, which you alternate between runs - this helps with overuse injuries.\nAs long as it‚Äôs more than an hour, taking a gel is more than recommended.\n\nUp to 30KMs\n\nTake up 1-2 isotonic + energy gels, the goal is to get 60-80g catbs per hour of your run.

Hence, I continue to keep an eye out for smaller models.\nThe big question here, is what use-cases do you actually use these on-device models for?\nI use them for a few select task, like, rewriting, summarizing, quick syntax lookups, or just quick vibe checks on a topic (asking the model to critique what I‚Äôve written) and creative explorations.\nThis brings us to Phi 3.5.

    "text": "Written on 26th December 2023, from Gurgaon, India.\nI‚Äôm currently in India, and as someone who doesn‚Äôt actively live in the country anymore, it is always a bittersweet experience whenever I travel between countries.\nTravelling to India üõ¨ - Is a joyride; it evokes the feeling of belongingness paired with the anticipation of meeting my loved ones, eating some good food (not butter chicken), and most of all, being in a place of comfort. It‚Äôs a place where I‚Äôve messed up umpteen numbers of times and gotten back up.\nTravelling out of India üõ´¬†- Is an emotional rollercoaster; not knowing when I will see my loved ones again evokes a feeling of emptiness, and the short life doesn‚Äôt make the departure easy. At the same time, the knowledge that I‚Äôll return to another country that I call home, living the life I chose, makes me feel elated.\nAll of this begs to answer the question: what is home? ‚ò∫Ô∏è\nI went to the mountains recently, which involved a lot of sitting in the car and a lot of time to ponder this topic.\nHere are some unkempt thoughts:\n\nIt is a place where you can be yourself. A place where you can express yourself without the fear of being judged.\nA place where you can be vulnerable.\nIt is a person who tells you you‚Äôve messed up and helps you while you fix it.\nWhere you feel motivated to get better (financially/ physically/ mentally) for your home.\nIt is a safe place where you can exist.\n\nIn the recent past (half a decade), I‚Äôve been quite lucky and privileged to build a few:\n\nMy best friend turned partner, Sofdog - My life wouldn‚Äôt be as worthwhile and fruitful as it is now if it weren‚Äôt for her watching out for me. Having tough conversations where we can be vulnerable and express ourselves without feeling judged, all whilst sharing the passion of exploring the world one city at a time.\nMum, Dad & my sister - Even though we‚Äôre often a couple of thousand kilometres apart, I‚Äôve never felt lonely all because these three have ensured I‚Äôve always been at ease. They‚Äôve always been there through thick and thin. I am lucky to have grown with such inclusive and progressive thoughts.\nFriends - Raquel, Patrick, Emils, Sven, and Zeina - Have played an important role in my life. They‚Äôve helped me max out life whilst being around me when I was hurting or guiding me when I was clueless.\nStuttgart - I spent my best life so far in Stuttgart. I got the time and space to dive deep into my research, all whilst making connections I‚Äôll cherish until the end. However, I‚Äôve moved away from Stuttgart recently. It will continue to be a place that I‚Äôll think fondly of.\n\nSo, in the end, what is home? üòä\nAs this year (2023) dawns to an end, I‚Äôm quite bullish on the next few. I can‚Äôt wait to build new homes.\nI‚Äôd love to know what makes you feel at home. Send me a DM on Twitter or drop me a ping at reachvaibhavs10[at]gmail[dot]com\nCheers! üçª VB\nAppendix - FAQ\n\nYou‚Äôve changed in recent times. That‚Äôs correct; I am a bit snobbier now (always a delhite); I take things way more lightly now. I‚Äôm more direct (don‚Äôt mince my words). I‚Äôm sorry if my words hurt you.\nDo I still have a tolerance for Spice? No.¬†It causes me intense pain in the belly. And no, I do not want to build it back up.\nDo I intend to come back to India to live long-term? Not in the immediate future (&lt; 2 years), and I do not plan life more than two years in advance. I‚Äôll continue to visit, albeit a bit more frequently now.\nWhat do you not like about India? First, I love Delhi, and it‚Äôll forever be my home. That said, I don‚Äôt like the political climate in India. I despise the pollution. The traffic is nightmare fuel. And no, this is not up for discussion. I find conversations like those to be not worth your or my time.\nPeople in tech get paid much more in India than in Europe. That‚Äôs great, and I‚Äôm quite happy for the tech scene in India.\nDo I make good money? I make enough to have food on the table and some occasional trips here and there. That‚Äôs more than sufficient for me. But, deffo something I will improve in ‚Äô24."

    "text": "Why I don‚Äôt take calls and take ages to respond?\nI often get my butt kicked for not responding to acquaintances and colleagues on time. I also get the stink eye for refusing to do meetings, phone/ zoom calls, and everything that comes with them.\nTo be honest, a one-hour physical meeting can be a 30-minute virtual meeting, a 30-minute virtual meeting can be a 10-minute phone call, and a 10-minute phone call can be a 2-minute email.\nI prefer written communication. It‚Äôs documented, clear, and doesn‚Äôt require me to break my focus.\nBut why avoid meetings in the first place? Isn‚Äôt face-to-face interaction better?\nI have the attention span of a peanut. It often takes me ages to find inspiration. Once I find that inspiration, I like capitalising on it as much as possible. Given how fickle my mind is I tend to aggressively preserve my ‚Äúinspired time‚Äù.\nWhile face-to-face interactions ‚Äúmay‚Äù be better. They do result in an absurd amount of cognitive load.\nSo why make life difficult for both you and me? Async rules!\nWhat about virtual meetings? They are a good proxy for in-person meetings and don‚Äôt often require as much time.\nTrue-ish, but if I know I have a meeting on a particular day, I‚Äôd constantly be stressing out about it. Irrespective of the contents of the meeting, I‚Äôd be consumed by it and have a sub-optimal experience.\nHow do I reach you?\nEmail me at Vaibhavs10[at]gmail[dot]com or drop a line on twitter @reach_vb ü§ó\nLive async, live happy!"

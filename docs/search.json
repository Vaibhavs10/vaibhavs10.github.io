    "text": "What am I focused on at this point in life?\nUpdated 13th April 2025, from Paris, FR.\n\n📚 Research & Work\n\nLife has been in hyper-drive since the last time I wrote one of these. My role at work (Hugging Face) has changed quite drastically, lot more high stakes and hell of a lot more fun. Be it collaborating with some of the top labs, researching Audio LMs, Text-to-Speech or about helping the team excute new product ideas/ directions - it has been a hoot and a half.\nIt’s also good realisation to take it easy every now and then, all gas and no pitstop is not as fun. That said, this job has pretty much made me an adrenaline junkie with so much cool stuff happening all around.\nI’m also quite lucky to have people who have my best interests around me at work too, looking at you Julien, Lys, and Pedro - priviliged to be working with these lads!\nFun tid-bit: I’ve understood that I’m good for nothing in the mornings and usually my brain kicks-in around mid-day.\nLesson from last couple months - you/ your team is as good as the incentives they are provided with, change the incentives, you can change the outcomes!\n\n\n🙌 Volunteering\n\nStill haven’t found the calm or the energy to get back to volunteering. More than the volunteering I do miss the friends I made along the way. I’m hoping I get a chance to meet some of these lovelies soon.\nOn the brightside, I’m moving on nicely from last years dramatic EuroPython :)\n\n\n🧠 Mental health\n\nBasically, endurance sports is all you need to get the good old man up in the head to stop playing tricks with you! Been running and biking off-late and it has been keeping me sane whilst everything around me is in hyperdrive.\nThis also means I have a huge dependence on running/ biking to take the edge off - spend Feb/ March battling with a crazy case of spint splints & plantar fasciitis and the mind did take a good toll.\nStill, overall it’s been mostly positive and I’m happy thet there’s a consistent way to channelise energy now!\n\n\n🏡 “Home”\n\nOof, loads of thinking about this one, whilst I really love where I live currently - it comes with it’s own side effects. Mostly comes down to how deeply integrated one is in their surroundings. I love the nature around but it still doesn’t feel like home, with friends scattered around different countries, I feel a little lost sometimes. It’s a chicken and egg problem, you need to put in the time to feel at home but at the same time because you don’t feel at home you put in time in mindless pursuits.\nHoping to figure out long term plans soon and put them in motion ^^’\n\n\n✈️ Travel & Public speaking\n\nAfter two years of hiatus from public speaking, I’m getting back into action this year with a few guest lectures/ workshops and talks lined up already. Going to be fun rest of the year and I’m here for it!"

Hence, I continue to keep an eye out for smaller models.\nThe big question here, is what use-cases do you actually use these on-device models for?\nI use them for a few select task, like, rewriting, summarizing, quick syntax lookups, or just quick vibe checks on a topic (asking the model to critique what I’ve written) and creative explorations.\nThis brings us to Phi 3.5. The other day, Microsoft released an update to their Phi series of small scale LLMs: Phi 3.5.\nThe highlight: Phi 3.5 mini, MoE and vision with 128K context, multilingual & MIT license! 🔥\nThe MoE beats Gemini flash and the Vision model is competitive with GPT4o.\nSome quick notes on the models and they atleast look good on benchmarks:\nMini with 3.8B parameters\nMoE with 16x3.8B (6.6B active - 2 experts)\nPh3.5 Vision with 4.2B params\nThe star of the show for me atleast is the Phi-3.5 Mini, it looks like decently sized model which would make it easy to fine-tune for specific tasks.\nAlright, enough of about the models, let’s try to see if we can run this model on your Mac/Windows/Linux device.\nThere are multiple ways to run a model on-device - you can use, transformers, llama.cpp, MLC, ONNXRuntime and bunch others. One of the easiest ways however is to use llama.cpp, once setup - it just works across pretty much all well-known model architectures."

    "text": "Written on 26th December 2023, from Gurgaon, India.\nI’m currently in India, and as someone who doesn’t actively live in the country anymore, it is always a bittersweet experience whenever I travel between countries.\nTravelling to India 🛬 - Is a joyride; it evokes the feeling of belongingness paired with the anticipation of meeting my loved ones, eating some good food (not butter chicken), and most of all, being in a place of comfort. It’s a place where I’ve messed up umpteen numbers of times and gotten back up.\nTravelling out of India 🛫 - Is an emotional rollercoaster; not knowing when I will see my loved ones again evokes a feeling of emptiness, and the short life doesn’t make the departure easy. At the same time, the knowledge that I’ll return to another country that I call home, living the life I chose, makes me feel elated.\nAll of this begs to answer the question: what is home? ☺️\nI went to the mountains recently, which involved a lot of sitting in the car and a lot of time to ponder this topic.\nHere are some unkempt thoughts:\n\nIt is a place where you can be yourself. A place where you can express yourself without the fear of being judged.\nA place where you can be vulnerable.\nIt is a person who tells you you’ve messed up and helps you while you fix it.\nWhere you feel motivated to get better (financially/ physically/ mentally) for your home.\nIt is a safe place where you can exist.\n\nIn the recent past (half a decade), I’ve been quite lucky and privileged to build a few:\n\nMy best friend turned partner, Sofdog - My life wouldn’t be as worthwhile and fruitful as it is now if it weren’t for her watching out for me. Having tough conversations where we can be vulnerable and express ourselves without feeling judged, all whilst sharing the passion of exploring the world one city at a time.\nMum, Dad & my sister - Even though we’re often a couple of thousand kilometres apart, I’ve never felt lonely all because these three have ensured I’ve always been at ease. They’ve always been there through thick and thin. I am lucky to have grown with such inclusive and progressive thoughts.\nFriends - Raquel, Patrick, Emils, Sven, and Zeina - Have played an important role in my life. They’ve helped me max out life whilst being around me when I was hurting or guiding me when I was clueless.\nStuttgart - I spent my best life so far in Stuttgart. I got the time and space to dive deep into my research, all whilst making connections I’ll cherish until the end. However, I’ve moved away from Stuttgart recently. It will continue to be a place that I’ll think fondly of.\n\nSo, in the end, what is home? 😊\nAs this year (2023) dawns to an end, I’m quite bullish on the next few. I can’t wait to build new homes.\nI’d love to know what makes you feel at home. Send me a DM on Twitter or drop me a ping at reachvaibhavs10[at]gmail[dot]com\nCheers! 🍻 VB\nAppendix - FAQ\n\nYou’ve changed in recent times. That’s correct; I am a bit snobbier now (always a delhite); I take things way more lightly now. I’m more direct (don’t mince my words). I’m sorry if my words hurt you.\nDo I still have a tolerance for Spice? No. It causes me intense pain in the belly. And no, I do not want to build it back up.\nDo I intend to come back to India to live long-term? Not in the immediate future (&lt; 2 years), and I do not plan life more than two years in advance. I’ll continue to visit, albeit a bit more frequently now.\nWhat do you not like about India? First, I love Delhi, and it’ll forever be my home. That said, I don’t like the political climate in India. I despise the pollution. The traffic is nightmare fuel. And no, this is not up for discussion. I find conversations like those to be not worth your or my time.\nPeople in tech get paid much more in India than in Europe. That’s great, and I’m quite happy for the tech scene in India.\nDo I make good money? I make enough to have food on the table and some occasional trips here and there. That’s more than sufficient for me. But, deffo something I will improve in ’24."

I also get the stink eye for refusing to do meetings, phone/ zoom calls, and everything that comes with them.\nTo be honest, a one-hour physical meeting can be a 30-minute virtual meeting, a 30-minute virtual meeting can be a 10-minute phone call, and a 10-minute phone call can be a 2-minute email.\nI prefer written communication. It’s documented, clear, and doesn’t require me to break my focus.\nBut why avoid meetings in the first place? Isn’t face-to-face interaction better?\nI have the attention span of a peanut. It often takes me ages to find inspiration. Once I find that inspiration, I like capitalising on it as much as possible. Given how fickle my mind is I tend to aggressively preserve my “inspired time”.\nWhile face-to-face interactions “may” be better. They do result in an absurd amount of cognitive load.\nSo why make life difficult for both you and me? Async rules!\nWhat about virtual meetings? They are a good proxy for in-person meetings and don’t often require as much time.\nTrue-ish, but if I know I have a meeting on a particular day, I’d constantly be stressing out about it.

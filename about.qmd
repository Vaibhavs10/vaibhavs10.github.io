I help teams tell better ML stories by pairing technical rigor with a conversational tone. If you want a quicker update, hop over to the [Now page](/now).

## Me in ten minutes

I’m an engineer at heart who likes to fix more things than he breaks. I research and democratise niche audio understanding, enhancement, and generation systems at the University of Stuttgart & Hugging Face.

I’ve consulted across the board—from scrappy startups to Fortune Technology 10 firms—to help them weave ML into day-to-day workflows and make sense of messy unstructured data silos. Along the way I co-founded a [Machine Learning for Audio study group](https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/ml-with-audio), mentor ML folks coming from non-traditional backgrounds, and continue to host research salons for friends across Europe.

::: {.side-note}
I’m always game for research collaborations and freelance consulting work. Ping me on Twitter ([@reach_vb](http://twitter.com/reach_vb)) and we’ll figure out the rest.

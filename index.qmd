# VB's thoughts, comments and musings

I write about production ML ergonomics, humane tooling, and the human stories behind research breakthroughs. Expect generous spacing, annotated side notes, and interactive flourishes inspired by distill.pub.

**Working on.** Reliable on-device assistants, audio-first LLM evals, and playful community demos for Hugging Face friends.

**Learning.** How to translate messy research diaries into narratives that are delightful to read and easy to remix.

## Current explorations

- Aligning long-form technical writing with the design grammar of distill.pub.
- Capturing running, travel, and mental models as structured sections so you can skim with purpose.
- Releasing small, remixable projects (like local Phi-4 setups) that encourage readers to tinker.
